Blockchain-Based Decentralized Voting System
Overview
This project is a blockchain-based decentralized voting system designed to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof method for conducting elections. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures that votes are recorded accurately and immutably, preventing any possibility of fraud or manipulation.

Features
Immutable Ledger: Every vote is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered or deleted.
Decentralization: The system operates on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for a central authority and reducing the risk of single points of failure.
Smart Contracts: Utilizes smart contracts to automate the voting process, including vote casting, tallying, and result verification.
Anonymity and Privacy: Voter identities are protected using cryptographic techniques, ensuring that votes are anonymous and private.
Real-Time Results: Votes are tallied in real-time, providing instant access to election results while maintaining data integrity.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm or yarn
Ethereum Wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
Truffle Suite (for smart contract development)
Ganache (for local blockchain testing)
Installation


npm install
Compile the smart contracts:


truffle compile
Migrate the smart contracts to the blockchain:


truffle migrate
Run the application:


npm start
Usage
Access the Voting System: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Cast a Vote: Connect your Ethereum wallet and follow the on-screen instructions to cast your vote.
View Results: Once voting is complete, the system will automatically tally the votes and display the results.
